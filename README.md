# Aylur's Gtk Shell

A customizable shell for Hyprland.
The goal of this project is to be something like [EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww), but offer predifined components instead of barebones widgets, so that you don't have to build your desktop from scratch, but still have the option to build custom components.
