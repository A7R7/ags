# Aylur's Gtk Shell

This program is essentially a library for gjs which allows defining GTK widgets in a declarative way in JavaScript. It also provides services to interact with the system so that these widgets can have functionality. It was heavily inspired by [EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww).

Currently only Wayland is supported, but there are plans for X11.
