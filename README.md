# Aylur's Gtk Shell

~~The goal of this project is to be something like [EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww), but offer predifined components instead of barebone widgets, so that you don't have to build your desktop from scratch, but still have the option to build custom components without any constraints.~~

## Get started

To get started read the [wiki](https://github.com/Aylur/ags/wiki).
Everything is still WIP and subject to change.
